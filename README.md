# Data analysis

What factors influence the number of accidents?


From the analysis of road accident data in the UK from 2005 to 2015, it appears that the number of accidents decreases almost every year. The highest number of accidents occurs in November on Fridays after 17 on single-carriageway roads in urban areas.
- In nearly 70% of cases, the road surface was dry, and the weather and lighting were good, which means that weather conditions are not the most significant factor.
- Approximately 83% of accidents occurred in areas where there were no pedestrian crossings, which may indicate that pedestrians constituted a small portion of the casualties.
- According to statistics, there were more vehicles involved in accidents than injured persons, suggesting that a significant portion of them were minor collisions. Fatal accidents occurred in 1% of cases.
- There are noticeably fewer accidents on Sundays.
