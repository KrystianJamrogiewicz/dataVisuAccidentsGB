The default interface presents data on accidents for the entire period (from 2005 to 2015). On the first page, you can narrow down this period to specific years and months, as well as by the severity of the accident. On the same page, you will find: the total number of accidents in the selected period, a chart showing the number of accidents on each day, a chart showing the number of accidents at each hour, a table with information about each accident, a map depicting the accident locations, and a pie chart showing the number of accidents based on road type.

The second page presents information about the severity of accidents, road conditions, the ratio of the number of people to the number of vehicles involved in accidents, and the presence of pedestrian crossings during the selected period on the first page.

The Summary page contains a decomposition tree that allows determining under what conditions the number of accidents was highest or lowest.


# Data analysis

What factors influence the number of accidents?


From the analysis of road accident data in the UK from 2005 to 2015, it appears that the number of accidents decreases almost every year. The highest number of accidents occurs in November on Fridays after 17 on single-carriageway roads in urban areas.
- In nearly 70% of cases, the road surface was dry, and the weather and lighting were good, which means that weather conditions are not the most significant factor.
- Approximately 83% of accidents occurred in areas where there were no pedestrian crossings, which may indicate that pedestrians constituted a small portion of the casualties.
- According to statistics, there were more vehicles involved in accidents than injured persons, suggesting that a significant portion of them were minor collisions. Fatal accidents occurred in 1% of cases.
- There are noticeably fewer accidents on Sundays.
